== Abstract

[.abstract-title]
The release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} contain a summary of the changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the {releaseBranch} development line.
This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the FreeBSD kernel and userland.
Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent}.
It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD.
It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents the latest point along the {releaseBranch} development branch since {releaseBranch} was created.
Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[].

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents a point along the {releaseBranch} development branch between {releasePrev} and the future {releaseNext}.
Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[].

This distribution of FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} is a {releaseType} distribution.
It can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[] or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) {releaseType} distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}/mirrors[Obtaining FreeBSD appendix] to the link:{handbook}/[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD.
The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release.
Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation.
An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD {releaseBranch} since {releasePrev}.
Note that some of the changes described here are also available in FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued after {releasePrev}, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.
They may also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices.
Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the man:freebsd-update[8] utility.
The link:{handbook}cutting-edge/#freebsdupdate-upgrade[binary upgrade procedure] will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release.
The man:freebsd-update[8] utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the instructions in [.filename]#/usr/src/UPDATING#.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up **all** data and configuration files.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
After installing the new userland software, running daemons are still from the previous version.
After installing the user-level components with the second invocation of freebsd-update, or via an upgrade from source with `installworld`, the system should be rebooted to start everything with the new software.
For example, older versions of `sshd` failed to process incoming connections correctly after the new [.filename]#/usr/sbin/sshd# was installed; rebooting started a new `sshd` and other daemons.
